# Homework 2 | Research free software/open source software alternatives.

## Part 1
   1. What are the advantages of open source?
      * Open Sources are usually free, and sometime it can be associated with **extra cost**.
      * Public collaboration, to improve the Open Source. Such as, finding bugs, new feature. In short period of time.
   
   2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
      * The basic freedom that make a software **Open Source** are:
        * The source code is accessible to the public.
        * You can see and also modify the source code.
     
   3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
      * I will split it in **Two categories**
        * Free software
          * If you are interested about free software. In another word, if you do not want the software to control. Open source software will match your need. Because you have that ability to modify the source code for your needs. 
        * Proprietary version   
          * This is opposite of **open source**. You only see or modify what your software provider grant you to see and modify. Unfortunately you do not have that power to change or modify anything. In this case, The software controls you, and software provider controls the software. 
   4. Watch the following video: Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES. Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer.
      * I am in the boat with him. It is crucial to know or agree or disagree what a software can or cannot do. If I decide to buy or use to software. It's normal that you as the owner to control the program not opposite one. The reason why **free software** is important. It gives you the freedom to run, study, and change as you wish. You can also make and distribute your copy. Also called **freedom 0, 1, 2, 3**.
