# The basic of Virtualization
## Definition
Replication of hardware o simulate a virtual machine inside a physical machine.

### Two type of virtualization:

* Server-side virtualization
* Client-side virtualization
 
## Server-side 
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
    
* Thick client or fat client
* Thin client
* Zero client

## Client-side 
* Software installed on a computer to manage virtual machines
* Each VM has its own OS installed
* The computer needs:
    * A hypervisor 
    * Hardware support
      * Capable CPU
      * Enough RAM
      * Enough STORAGE

## Type 1 Vs Type 2 Hypervisor

## Benefits of Virtualization 

+ Allows running multiple OSs on one machine.
+ Reduces costs by decreasing the physical hardware that must be purchased for a network.

### Example of VMs

+ VirtualBox
  + It is **Type 2** virtualization product 
  + Open Source software
  + supports a **Large** number of guest OSs

+ VMWare Workstation Player
  + Type 2
  + Available for **Linux** and **Windows**
  + supports a **Large** number of guest OSs

### Can my computer virtualize?

Your computer should meet the following minimal specifications:
+ AMD V or INTEL V compatible processor
+ DUAL core x64 processor with 1.3 GHz or faster 4GB of RAM
+ Enough free HARD DRIVE space for installing guest OSs.
